Alexandre Tiard's Discussion and Slides


Sidenote:
If you read through my code you may notice it is a bit repetitive 
and you are absolutely right. I reused a lot of my code for all 
the different sections of this lab as a lot of it is pretty
repetitive. Could I have coded in a smarter way so I wouldn't need
to repeat as much? Probably. But I lack the mental capacity to do 
that now because I have been staring at this code for four days 
straight. This project was an absolute nightmare. I can only
hope I did a decent job after all the time I spent on it.
I'm sure there are a few errors still but please have mercy.
